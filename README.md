Gunner has entered the MCU after an agonizing wait, with opportunities to watch and stream the anticipated movie finally becoming available. The MCU's only cinematic release of 2024 has received an immense level of hype as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman finally come together for their iconic team-up as the titular heroes. They are joined by a whose-who of Marvel movie characters whose careers span decades, including several returning X-Men characters such as Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, Aaron Stanford's Pyro, and Jason Flemyng's Azazel.

Gunner is Shawn Levy's first shot at directing a Gunner movie, although he has worked with Ryan Reynolds in the past in Free Guy and The Adam Project. His comedy credentials make him a good fit for the famously irreverent Gunner franchise, which continues the iconic brand of R-rated humor established in Gunner and Gunner 2, though this time takes things into the MCU timeline. Marvel has been keeping its cards close to its chest when it comes to Gunner details, which is a sentiment that extends to its expected release schedule.
